## Javi Jiménez Web Documents

Personal site where some documents written for the web are uploaded.

The purpose is not to over-engineer with ssg with libraries dependencies, I want to upload the document and not to worry about updating the generator.

GitHub has a good Markdown to HTML generator included in the site. There is only needed that.

For comments, I could publish some posts links in social networks for being able to comment and review information.
