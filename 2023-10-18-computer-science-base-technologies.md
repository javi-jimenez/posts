There is some knowledge, that you already have, for being a good computer science engineer.

That knowledge come from time ago, when the name of [_Al-Khwarizmi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi) made possible the term _algorithm_.

All people is able to think about algorithms, we do it constantly, when we plan for a sequence of steps and take into account some possible conditions and routes that the facts could drive us to.

That would be the very first step in 'programming' computers, thinking about algorithms.

To the end, the purpose of programming is to tell to the computer, what we want that it do for us.

If you think in algorithms and you plan to tell it to a computer, for it do it for you, you are programming.

An important step is how to tell to the machine that it has to do what you planned in your algorithm, perhaps, drawed in a paper.

You can write down on paper a list of steps or you can make a drawing with that list of steps.

If you drawed it on paper, perhaps you have something similar to a [flowchart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart).

That is the first step in the programming computer path.

All people is able to do it, and could be doing it right now.

But, as fire usages inventions, things could improve and become really complex.

Perhaps this night, James Wright could be relaxed, thinking about his ideas, when he takes a rest and sits around a bonfire waiting for enjoying his cooked food.
