We need a Network Operative System for managing Internet Network and Applications.

Nowadays, we have an operative system for managing Internet apps.

It is Kubernetes, the state of art of Applications Operative System (AOS).

As we know it now, the underlying concept is that applications need to be deployed in any system, at any place, anytime.

It is used today as a bottom layer for application deployments, but it is too complex for simple deployments, we need only a simple binary which can accomplish the task.

A solution is the [k3s project](https://k3s.io/), a minimal Kubernetes Certified distribution.

The following work, about the concept and use of Applications Operative System, AOS, will be based on that concept.
