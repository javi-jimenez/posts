Today James Wright gets to the rest time of the day tired, but happy, he knows that he did it well, the better he could do it.

That happiness carries his mind to a stage of peace and creativity, tonight I will rest well, he thinks, but now I am going to give some of my knowledge and ideas to some special people.

When he is thinking that, he is thinking in the kind of person that is not as lucky as he, the person that wants to have spare time to share it with other, by nothing more than knowing that his ideas and thoughts will arrive to other minds and, he thinks, they will enjoy them as much as he is enjoying when he is inmerse in that world of creating 'thinks'.

Another kind of thoughts, not merely from his mind, but from his heart, is saying he a similar thing, to share the ideas and knowledge, but in this sense, the main argument is that there is people that, despite not having the same ideas and lines of thought, is wanting to receive those ideas about old, current and future things, perhaps imagining, but with the best intention.

The intention of his heart comes after knowing or thinking about an idea that appears in his life, and later the heart whispers to his mind that it could be of help for someone in some place or perhaps in some time if the idea could pass the test of time.

Wright, does that, he thinks about that idea with his mind, and returns to the people the results of his thoughts in an envelope made with the whisper of his heart.

This night James Wright can go to sleep in peace.

_Note: Imagine: To form a mental picture or image of the ideas, in this case._
